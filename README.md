# ff7-to-fbx

Translates Final Fantasy VII graphics assets to FBX format.

# Overview

Sorry, this project was abandoned in early 2019 and never cleaned up.

All in the information in this README is being recollected in 2023,
four years after it was abandoned, so it might not be complete or accurate.

If anyone is interested in more details, just contact the author.

# Pre-requisites

## Language

Python

## Libararies

This project really ought to have a requirements.txt file or a Pipfile.

But I'm embarrassed to say, it doesn't.

This Python app will need to `import fbx`.

That library is provided by Autodesk, if I remember correctly.

For now, it's up to the reader to install this Python library,
and any other libraries that might be imported.

## External tool required

This project also depends on a separate tool to translate FF7 
from native format to an intermediate JSON format, which is the starting
point for THIS app.

If I remember correctly, this is a tool within the kujata project.

# Usage

Translation order is: FF7 native -> JSON -> FBX

1. Use ff7Translator tool from an EXTERNAL project (TBD)
to translate FF7 native files -> JSON.

2. Use fbxTranslator.py in THIS project
to translate JSON -> FBX.

# FAQ

- Q. What is "ff7Translator tool" in step 1?

- A. If I remember correctly, this step is done by a tool within the kujata project.
For more information, please contact: picklejar76@gmail.com

- Q. What are all the input parameters for? And experimenter.py?

- A. Japanese game engines use a left-handed coordinate system.
This means that 3D models get screwed up when running in western systems.
In order to work around this problem, data must be interpreted and translated
in a different way. This involves changing X/Y/Z axis flipping, rotations, etc.
The experimeter.py generates a ton of these different combinations.
Almost all of them produce garbage results.
Only 1 combination produced a usable result, although it was "upside down".

- Q. This project seems to be missing some key files?

- A. That's definitely possible. Sorry.
Look in the `fbx` directory for examples of *.fbx files that
were generated by this tool 4 years ago. If you're lucky,
some of them might be usable.
